Generating Figure 1 Using MicrobiomeAnalyst
(https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/MicrobiomeAnalyst/ModuleView.xhtml)

This analysis uses the MicrobiomeAnalyst web platform to upload three data files and generate Figure 1.

# 1. File Preparation

The following files were uploaded to MicrobiomeAnalyst:
	1.	micro_S5w.csv - Microbial abundance data.
	2.	SampleInfoOPOR5ws.csv - Sample metadata file.
	3.	taxonomy.csv - Taxonomy information.
	
	
# 2. Analysis Steps

On the MicrobiomeAnalyst platform:
	1.	Data Upload: Import the three files into the corresponding input fields.
	2.	Visualization:
	•	Generate Alpha Diversity and Beta Diversity plots to explore microbial diversity.
	•	Generate LEfSe bar plots to illustrate the differences in microbial composition between groups
